## Featured Projects:

### [SkillSwapper](https://github.com/cswylie/SkillSwapper)
This is a full stack web application developed by myself and 5 other UCSC undergraduate students as a project for CSE115a: Introduction to Software Development. It is a web platform that connects people in their communities by exchanging oneâ€™s skills and time for anotherâ€™s without the exchange of monetary currency. There is a relevant README in the project repository, and there are also instructions on how to run and use the web application. I specifically helped develop a lot of the backend, which includes:
* Testing Suite
* Authentifciation Services
  * Including Secure Account Authentification Middleware 
* Firebase Database Management
* Account Services and Endpoints
  * Using TSOA to create REST APIs  
* Creating and maintaining cookies for users.
#### Technologies Used:
ReactJS | JavaScript | TypeScript | HTML/CSS | NodeJS | ExpressJS | Firebase
